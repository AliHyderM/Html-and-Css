        A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these
        sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,
        and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the
        bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in
        the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my
        talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present
        moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When,
        while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian
        sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees,
        and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw
        myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie
        close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I
        hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar
        with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I
        feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and
        the breath

        Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia
        and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
        Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
        ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
        with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which
        roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful
        Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost
        unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
        name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The
        Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
        Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind
        Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into
        the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills
        of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her
        hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the
        subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran
        over her cheek, then
